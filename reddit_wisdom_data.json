So this way we don’t disturb each other. On weekends we will usually sleep in the same bed cause our schedules are more matched. The other reason is because my husband snores like a freight train and I can’t tolerate wearing earplugs every night. \n\nI’ve had friends who were weirded out/concerned about our arrangement but there is really no need. Our relationship is strong and our intimacy is unaffected. Actually, it’s better cause we aren’t disturbing each other and we can both sleep!",

      "Years ago, I was at the mall with my mom and my sister. There was this pretzel place across from the food court that sold lemonade. We went to the pretzel place and bought three lemonades, then we went across the hall to the food court to get pizza. We sat down and began eating. The lemonade was not very good. Whatever, not a big deal, my sister and I were thirsty, so we drank it anyway. My mother did not drink hers and complained the entire time.\n\nAfter we finished our pizza, my mother dragged us back over to the pretzel shop and demanded a full refund for all three lemonades. The cashier was very polite and refunded her lemonade since she didn't drink any of it, but (rightfully) did not refund the lemonades that my sister and I drank.\n\nThis was not good enough for my mother and she proceeded to pitch a hissy fit. I am so relieved that this all took place before cell phones, because otherwise we'd have videos of \"Lemonade Karen\" circulating all over the damn internet. The cashier offered coupons, but did not refund the lemonades that my sister and I drank. By this point, my sister and I were thoroughly embarrassed and begging our mother to just drop it and leave. Finally, she did.\n\nShe spent the entire car ride home yelling at us because we drank our lemonades and this apparently made her look like an idiot.",
      "It’s not that she’s done just one, super, terrible thing, it’s that it’s a *pattern* of poor behavior and whining. \n\nI don’t go to restaurants with my mom anymore because she just has no manners. Asking for the temperature in the restaurant to be adjusted, complaining about a water spot on her silverware, snapping her fingers to get the waitstaff’s attention, being generally rude to them, looking for things wrong with her meal so she can complain to the manager and get a discount/ etc. \n\nAnd it’s not just restaurants. She actually wants to write a book essentially about how to complain enough that you get free/ discounted items at hotels, grocery stores, through Amazon, with your phone bill, etc.. She’s proud of this behavior.",

I don't lie on my quotes, and after they run the reports on all drivers/vehicles, my price is always exactly the same as the quote price. I have had it change before, but only when I've missed adding data from the previous policy. I don't shop around - I'm making these quotes on my current insurance's site. I've been with the same insurance company the whole time.\n\n(when I say the price is the exact same, I mean that after I decide to go with the new quote and they run my driving history and all that, the anonymous quoted price does not change from what I am eventually charged. I'm comparing a new anonymous quote's price to my current policy's renewal price)\n\nI've moved states so I've only done this 3 times so far, but each time I've gotten a cheaper price. The first time it was around (I'll be using pay in full prices) $150 cheaper. The second time was about $350 cheaper. The third time was $650 cheaper. Nothing's changed, and in just the last year, my policy is $1000 cheaper (comparing what I paid 12 months ago to what I paid this time). Exact same coverage. Same motor history, accident report. Same everything. $1000 cheaper. Insured drivers have a clean driving history the whole time. Cars have had no accidents.\n\nI always call my car insurance company once I've confirmed the quote price is cheaper. I explain I've made a new quote, give them my previous policy's renewal price, and tell them to make it happen. And they do. Every time I do it I tell myself I just had a $$$/hr phone call (adjusted per savings amount).",

    "selftext": "I’m an older guy, but I’ve had to change flat tires on a road and even interstate highways at least a dozen times. Young drivers need to know how to find a safe way to pull off the road, plus every aspect of changing the tire.  \n\nFinding the spare, the jack, the wrench, and wheel chocks if you have them. Show them the jack points on the car, because newer cars will be damaged if you put a scissor jack in the wrong place. Loosen the lug nuts or lug bolts a little before jacking up the car. How to free frozen lug nuts. How to get the wheel off if it is stuck on. How to attach the tire, remove the jack, and then snug up the lugs. \n\nI don’t mean to be sexist in any way, but speaking as a parent myself, it is critical than young ladies learn how to do this, and not just young men. Roadside assistance services are not always available, and unfortunately, not everyone who stops to help is an actual Good Samaritan. \n\nA few more general tips, as I have had super bad luck with the sheer volume of flat tires I’ve had to fix. \n\n- Every 2 years or so, loosen the lug nuts/bolts on all tires on all your cars, then re-tighten them. This is for 2 reasons. First, if the wheel has not been removed in a long time, the threads can be either rusted or micro-welded together, making it damn difficult to break the nut/bolt loose. I have had to find a piece of pipe that slipped over the wrench handle, then repeatedly jump on it, to break nuts loose. Second, if you take your car to a mechanic to have the tires rotated or to get new tires - these guys often use power tools to put the nut on, and they over-torque it, making it very hard to break loose with hand tools. \n\n- put a very large rubber mallet or a 3 foot long, cleanly cut 4x4 in your trunk. Most cars that use lug bolts (instead of lug nuts) have a small (3/16-1/4 inch, or 4-6mm) cylindrical projection on the brake rotor, and a matching recess on the back side of the wheel. The reason for this thing is so you can lift up the tire and get it to mate with the brake rotor, then just rotate the wheel until the holes in the wheel line up with the threaded holes in the brake rotor, so you can insert the lug bolts while being able to keep the wheel roughly in place with one hand.  If the wheel has not been removed for years, these two surfaces can seize, so that even after you remove the lug bolts, you still can’t get the wheel off. So essentially, you need to hit the wheel rim with a big “thumper” to break it loose. \n\nHope this lengthy LPT helps keep you and your kids more safe, if they get a flat.",

I now complete difficult tasks in focused bursts when my brain is naturally ready for them.\n\nThis method has been especially helpful for my ADHD. Instead of feeling broken because I couldn't maintain focus for 8 straight hours, I learned to leverage my natural peaks and plan around the valleys.\n\nIf you struggle with conventional productivity methods, try tracking your own patterns for a week. You might discover your brain has a natural rhythm that doesn't match standard advice.\n\nTo be transparent, I've started developing an app around this idea, but I'm not here to advertise or sell anything.

I lived in a studio for a while, and I never studied in bed or watched tv there. The bed was only for sleeping (and you know). Otherwise I’d get sleepy while studying, or stay awake thinking of school instead of drifting off to sleep. The moment I’m in bed it’s bc I’m going to sleep. \n\nIf separate spaces isn’t an option for you, there are still solutions. When working from home started, I had to have my desk in my room (lived with dad and sister) and hated it. The bed was mere feet away and it was easy to just flop onto bed instead of working. So because I couldn’t change the space, I added things like “I only wear this perfume when I’m working. I always listen to this playlist when I’m working. Lunchtime doesn’t change on workdays.” I even gave myself a “commute” by immediately taking a 30 min walk to mimic my drive home. My bedroom was multi-purpose, but other things weren’t. \n\nWhen I moved into a hybrid schedule that need shifted a little, but now that I own a 2-story and live alone, I never go upstairs unless I’m working in my office (where all I ever do there is work and nothing else, I leave it the moment I’m done working) getting dressed or going to bed. Every space has a designated task and it helps separate my brain via associations so I can shift from task to task relatively easily. I’m asleep in less than 8 minutes bc my room isn’t where I go to “hang out.” I know that’s not always possible if you don’t live alone, so designating and associating other controllables can help here.",

    "title": "LPT Request: How do I get through 12 hour shifts at my assembly line job, when finding other work seems impossible?",
    "selftext": "I work 12 hour shifts on an assembly line, and getting through the shifts is brutal. Most of the common suggestions don't work in my case. I can't talk to anyone there as nobody is talkative; many of them don't want to speak at all, regardless of language or experiences or anything. There's often a 3-hour period where not a word of conversation is uttered by anyone on the entire factory floor (including two assembly lines and a testing area). There were only two people who wanted to hold a conversation there, and they both quit two weeks ago.\n\nWe're highly micromanaged and don't get to choose our own break times or spots to sit in, we can't have any food on the factory floor (no snacks) or even refill water/coffee/tea until our breaktimes. We can take bathroom breaks if they're short, but other than that we are not allowed to move from our stations until the end of the night.\n\nWe can't look at our phones during the shift except on breaks, wear headphones or earbuds, or play music through our phone speakers. Bringing a portable radio *might* be possible (I'll ask next week).\n\nThe most I can do is choose whether I stand or sit (although most of the work requires sitting), push my chair from one side of my table to the other, sip water (has to last me 3 hours per refill, so slowly), and go to the bathroom.\n\nTo top it all off, the work comes at an agonizing pace that is too slow to get into a flow and too fast to zone out and take mental breaks. Generally, I'll get something that takes 15 seconds to do every 30 seconds. Also if one of the production lines finishes their daily quota before the day's out, there is an endless supply of \"prepwork\" and other busywork to keep us occupied as the manager does not want anyone to be \"idling\". So even if we finish our work early, there's endless fake work waiting. Last week I spent an hour manually checking parts that I had already confirmed were good before, they just handed me a box of 500 pieces that had already been checked and I checked it again.\n\nI'm seriously at my wit's end here. This job is crushing my soul. I don't even have the energy to apply to anything else on my off days because I'm so burnt out.\n\nThis isn't even mentioning the physical issues; my feet are soaking in their own sweat in my steeltoes which causes a ton of skin issues despite trying to wear moisture-wicking socks, and I don't have enough room to even wiggle my toes which gets oppressive. My shoulders are killing me from repetitive strain, and I have to spend half of both my breaks going to the very back of the building (by the loading docks) where my locker is to get some hand lotion so my skin stops cracking. We have to wear these cheap ESD straps that need to be pulled so tight they dig in and irritate. The air in there is full of dust that makes my nose just that little bit irritated, and because there's irritants used in the production process it's very hard to get the chance to scratch your face or anything.\n\nThe management/supervision is also nasty. Not a big deal, but when there's already so many annoyances going on, it starts to upset me.\n\nAny help? I'm seriously dying out here. I've been here a few weeks already, seen all the good conversationalists quit, but I have nowhere to go back to other than this (coming from a highly abusive home environment in a city where rent is prohibitively high). I don't see myself getting used to this at all; the tedium and discomfort is *killing me.* The pay here isn't even that good (1.3x minimum wage) but the job market is so bad right now there's not anything else I can do. I have an associates and a bachelors, both in STEM, and have sent over 350 applications out just since mid-November yet have gotten nothing. I've hired private career coaches and used my university's career services, gone to job fairs and networking events, reached out to everyone I know in industry, and there's just nothing. The market is bone dry unless you're an experienced professional wanting to work for below-newcomer rates - like literally taking what new grads are historically supposed to make, slashing it by 20%, and then only accepting people whose experience should be earning them double that.\n\nAny advice?",

    "selftext": "Ecologist here! It's that time of year again when the ground is covered in baby birds, some should be there and some should not. So here are a few tips so you know when to intervene and when to leave them alone.\n\nIf you find a baby bird on the ground the first thing to do is check for injuries. Baby birds can look pretty weak, but if you don't see any blood or obvious damage then it's fine. If it is injured do not try to take it home and nurse it back to health, birds require specific diets and handling and even most of them don't make it when cared for by their parents let alone an unequipped human. Please call a wildlife rehabber.\n\nThe second thing to check for is age:\n\nIf it hasn't opened its eyes yet and is mostly pink and featherless it's a hatchling (0-3 days old). Hatchlings should not be out of the nest. If you see a hatchling and the nest it fell out of you can try to put it back in (that old wive's tale about birds not taking care of chicks touched by humans is false). If you can't see the nest you can make your own out of a small container lined with soft material then attach it to a tree or bush as high as you can. If it looks like the parents are not caring for it after an hour or so call a local wildlife rehabber to come get the hatchling. If the bird is invasive, a starling or house sparrow for example (invasive in the Americas and other parts of the world, they are native to Europe and important parts of ecosystems in their native range), a lot of rehabbers euthenize them.\n\nIf its eyes are open and it's got a few spikey (pin) feathers it's a nestling (3-13 days old) and also not ready to leave the nest. Please adhere to the advice above about hatchlings.\n\nIf its eyes are open and its fully feathered, hopping around, maybe a little fluffy, short tail, its a fledgling (13+ days old). Leave these cuties alone! They are working on flying and probably exhausted and in need of rest before they take off again. Their parents are around, even if you cannot locate them, and are feeding this little guy or gal. No need to call anyone or do anything unless it is injured. If it is in the street and might get hit by a car you can herd them to the side of the road or under a bush. The parents will find it.\n\nI know everyone means well and it's hard to look at a baby bird and not want to do anything. But you only need to worry about the hatchlings and nestlings or an injured fledgling.\n\nQuick Note - Some birds are ground nesters so they will be on the ground no matter what, but the chances of you finding a ground nesting bird is not very high. If you're in the U.S. Killdeer, ovenbirds, bobolinks, swans, ducks, geese, etc. all nest on the ground and their chicks will be there in all their forms. Shorebirds also nest on the ground, so if you're at the beach you'll see plover, sanderlings, and other wading birds. This post is really for folks finding non-ground nesting birds in urban and suburban areas.\n\nIf you have an outdoor cat or dog, please stop trying to change the wild bird behavior. Take your pet, which is an invasive species, into your home until the bird leaves the area. Monitor your dog or cat while outside, keep them in if you can't supervise while chicks are out. It's only a few weeks you have to pay attention.",

Cut the bristles as close to the hair as possible, and I found using snip plyers from my garage worked very well.

    "title": "LPT \"Driving\" on virtual calls is a good skill to have to get noticed and become part of higher level meetings in an office job setting.",
    "selftext": "If you're in an office job, there may be times when there is live collaboration over a zoom/teams call: Talking about changes to a presentation and editing it live, working on a shared document, brainstorming ideas, testing new code. In these settings, being the \"driver\" (the person who shares their screen and often makes edits offered by the other callers) can be a great way to facilitate the meeting in a way that's noticed and sought out by management. Often managers have split attention and little time to work on things directly so being able to help realize their vision live on a call is very valuable. \n\nTo be a good driver you should:\n\n-Be fast. Learn as many shortcuts, hot keys, formulas and \"hacks\" for the relevant softwares that you use. There's a point where if you cannot drive as fast as the meeting moves, the meeting becomes inefficient and it's better to just schedule a follow-up and do the work off the call. This is fine, but the skill is being able to drive fast enough that you can finalize a lot in one meeting with managers who are hard to pin down for working sessions. Even if you're good at PowerPoint, excel, coding, writing, drawing; doing it quickly can be a different skill altogether.\n\n-Prioritize the \"version 1\". When ideas are being thrown around it's better to just create rough versions and leave polish for when you are working on it independently. The most important thing to do on a call, especially with managers, is understand what they're looking for, give them a rough draft, confirm that you understood them, and then come back later with a finished product.\n\n-Learn driving language. \"So we're good with this part as is?\", \"What do we think about this?\", \"What I'm hearing is that you want me to ___, is that right?\", \"I can fix the formatting off the call, but is this basically what we're looking for?\". You want to encourage feedback, but also gently encourage participants to confirm verbally their approval as you go. If they don't like it, get them to say what and why.\n\n-Do as much pre work as you can. If you have multiple versions or a rough outline ready to go ahead of time, editing live becomes easier.\n\n-When no editing or document is involved, good driving can just be taking good notes that you can distribute after a call. Many times I share screen with my notes just so people on the call have something to look at. Managers who spend lots of time in meetings appreciate notes like these and will often clarify their own thoughts more when they see them written out. Emphasize action items if there are any and who is responsible for each one.\n\n-A second screen is important as a driver if there are things you want to do that you don't want to show up on your shared screen. \n\nIf you are a good driver you may find yourself getting invited onto calls with bosses above your direct boss. Boomers especially love having someone just create what they say verbally. It lets them work as fast as they can think which they might not be able to do on their own. You also get to be a part of more of the idea generation process and offer your own insights where appropriate. \n\nA lot of this advice is geared towards project based work, but any job that has collaborative virtual calls can benefit from a skilled driver.\n\nETA: \"Driving\" is what people in my office call being the person to share their screen. Probably goes by other names elsewhere, but when we pass the screen share off some one will usually say something to the effect \"I'll start driving\".\n\nPeople made the excellent point that being the driver can be a slippery slope to getting pigeon holed into admin work or note taking. I'll just say there are different levels of driving in my mind:\n\n1. Taking dictation: You are simply there to type out or draft the ideas of the other call participants. You are not given the opportunity to contribute and therefore your involvement is literally the key strokes on the screen. This is bad, and you don't want to get stuck in this especially if your job description does not specifically call for it. If you fill this role you might want to create a boundary that this is outside your scope of work or it should at least not fall solely on your shoulders.\n\n2. Facilitating: You are interpreting ideas, creating consensus and encouraging feedback from the most important stakeholders. Here you are not only taking in ideas from participants but also offering your own perspective. The keystrokes and drafting are more incidental to taking an active role in the call and this is a synthesis of soft social skills and being proficient in software to create work product live. \n\n3. Leading: This is what a driver further into their career will do. You are the one ideating and distributing action items and defining requirements. Where the driving skillset is still relevant is in soliciting questions, creating mock ups that subordinates can use as starting points to create finished work, and fostering a collaborative environment. You can also model how to drive a collaborative call and maybe foster the skills in others.",

And they’re still on my App Library so I keep seeing and being prompted by it. \n\nSo what I recently found useful to curb my habit of mindlessly opening social media or game apps is to “hide” them. \n\nHow to do this:  hold down on the app and then select require passcode, then select hide and require passcode. \n\nThis then puts them in a hidden folder and away from the App Library or Home Screen so it’s not just constantly in your view and you will have to “go out of your way” to open the app. Also, once you navigate away from the app it won’t be in your list of opened windows so you’ll have to find it again and open/input passcode to reopen so again. \n\nAdding this little bit of resistance helped me kind of forget about the apps since most of the time I’m just opening them out of boredom.

If you have local acquaintances that enjoy the same things you do, try inviting them to events and hangouts and slowly build up that relationship.\nAlso, stay open minded. You may invest a fair bit of time with someone and figure out they're just not your kind of person. That's okay, y'alls can still be acquaintances, but don't push for more just because of the investment.\n\nAlso, keep attending social affairs where you can run into more people, and make more friends.

With regular use, it breaks down (she said “eats”) the rubber seals.

After my first bachelor degree, I worked as a nurse for several years. \n\nNow, years later, I'm back in school, trying to do the same thing as high schoolers fresh off graduation and I'm finding it difficult to stay motivated. \n\nThe things I'm learning are interesting enough, and I do decently (grade-wise), but I dread every time I have to sit down and do school work. \n\nI'm imploring you guys for some tips, how can I gameify/incentivize my studies to make it a little easier and more rewarding mentally? \n\nThank you so much!",

Get 500 words written and you can text a friend to make plans to meet up or for a call. \n\nThe key for the coaxing method is that the metaphorical carrot can't be food or you may end up accidentally over indulging.

Even if you have some of the smaller bandaid, or the ones designed for knuckles or finger tips, they still don't tend to be that comfortable. They can restrict movement, block sensory input and get soggy when you wash your hands.\n\nPlain pimple patches (the non medicated ones) are just hydrocolloid bandages. For small injuries like a paper cut or torn hangnail, they can be amazing. It being covered with a pimple patch can stop a lot of the irritation, keep out germs and promote faster healing. They are less noticeable and blend in better than a traditional bandaid.\n\nI scraped the top of my little toe while swimming.  it was small but suprisingly irritating. It rubbing against a sock or shoe was uncomfortable, but less uncomfortable than when I tried putting a regular bandaid (all i had available) on it. A pimple patch worked great for it.\n\nI've had some kids in my life who have sensory issues and bandaids tend to be a no go. My young nephew picked at a hangnail which tore leaving a small but irritating wound, kept complaining about it and picking at it. I told him about my magic bandaids that are clear and little and don't go all the way around like normal bandaid. He agreed to try it, and I asked him about an hour later how it felt and he said he forgot he even had it on. \n\nSince they are small, flexible, and non toxic, they tend to be less of a choking hazard than regular bandaids too. Not that I recommend eating them, but it's probably safer than a regular bandaid for kids who put everything in their mouths but I'm not a doctor and that's just my personal assumption as a parent who once had to call her child's pediatrician while crying because her 11 month old took off her shoe and sock and ate a bandaid in a literally less than 2 minute car ride to the other side of the neighborhood.

Out of desperation, we tried sitting back-to-back—and the pain disappeared almost instantly.\n\nTurns out, when you sit like that, you’re basically giving each other free lumbar support. It helps you stay upright without straining your spine or core muscles. Your posture naturally improves, and your back muscles finally get to relax. There's even a bit of a passive massage effect from the subtle movements and pressure against each other's backs.\n\nIf you're ever stuck sitting on the ground at a concert, in a long line, or while camping, give it a shot. It's simple, effective, and surprisingly comfortable. Just don’t forget to thank your new human chair.",

      "I've told this story before, but I think it bears repeating.\n\nSeveral years ago, I became fascinated by wood turning videos on YouTube. So one day, I had some massive coupon for Harbor Freight, and I went out and bought their smallest wood lathe. It was a simple but functional machine, and before long, I was turning wooden pens, razor handles, and the like. \n\nIt was really enjoyable, relaxing, and I spent quite a bit of time doing it making some really cool things. Before too long, I had given everyone that I knew a pen or some other wooden trinket, so I started accumulating finished products.\n\nI had made a dozen or so hard wood safety razor handles, and a friend convinced me that they would sell well on Etsy.\n\nI set up an Etsy store, took some photos, and posted them. Before too long, I'd sold them all, and was getting requests for more.\n\nAs the Christmas holiday approached, I had customers reaching out with special requests, and any stock that I had flown off the virtual shelves.\n\nI'd made enough profit to buy a really, really nice Jet lathe and a set of turning tools far superior to my Harbor Freight specials.\n\nHowever, I was spending just about every free minute (that I wasn't working my real job) either making product, or packaging and shipping stuff, or taking photos to make listings. I got my wife to help so that I could focus on the actual wood turning.\n\nThings accelerated more, and I gave myself a pretty nasty case of tendonitis (common amongst wood turners).\n\nI had to take a break for about six weeks, so I temporarily closed up shop while I healed.\n\nThat was probably 8 years ago.\n\nI haven't fired up my lathe since. The pressure of needing to meet customer expectations, make a good product, and deliver on time ruined the relaxing fun that I was having with a little hobby.\n\nI'll go back to wood turning some day, but I won't sell a damned thing.",

      "I worked for about 6 months as a customer service rep at a Dish Network call center. It was a fucking hellish nightmare that I wouldn't wish on anyone. Even if a lot of the callers were nice, the system itself is designed to piss everyone off. You have to stick to a script, the calls just keep coming, and you're supposed to transfer people to tier 2 tech support if you run out of stuff to troubleshoot from the script (hint: basically if a reboot doesn't fix it, transfer). You are timed and penalized if you go over time, you are monitored constantly, and surveys make or break you. \n\nBasically, if you get anything under a 5 star survey result then prepare to have a meeting with upper management. Additionally, positive surveys resulted in bonuses. If it weren't illegal to dock pay based on bad survey results then I'm sure they would have implemented that. They did everything they could to penalize bad survey results (read: anything under 5 stars), and I'm positive it has led to firings. \n\nI truly wanted to help people, and I frequently risked my job as a result. I realize there's nothing worse than being transferred and put on hold and having to explain your situation all over again, and I'm highly tech savvy, so I would spend as much time as needed to resolve the problem. This resulted in longer call times than usual, but higher survey numbers. I am certain this is a contributing factor to why I wasn't axed. \n\nBefore I started that job I was discerning with how I handed out survey answers and naturally have an aversion to giving anything a maximum rating. I also avoided surveys like the plague, seeing them as a giant waste of time and meaningless. After working that job you bet your ass I started doing every survey offered to me and rating everyone a 5/5, even if I felt they weren't particularly helpful. The system is broken, and I feel awful for anyone subject to it. \n\nBe nice to your call center support. Be respectful of their time, be polite and caring, ask to speak to their supervisor and tell them what a good job their team member is doing. Give 5 stars on everything. Those jobs suck and the people doing them aren't paid enough, try to make their lives better if you can.",

One account I've seen started 3 years ago, the person was really into knitting, didn't post for 2 years and now spam posts maga nonsense at all times of the day and night. This is often when someone has bought/hacked or taken over an old genuine account.\n\nLook at the username - is it Randomly_generated88 (could well be a bot or a sock puppet account).\n\nHow old is the account? Was it created last week? Less likely to be a genuine person, more likely to be a bot or troll/sock puppet.\n\nWhat's their karma? -100 is a troll, ignore them.\n\nLook at their post history - is it literally all the same edgy troll comments, history of only posting politics? It'sikely a bot or a troll.\n\nLook at their language. Lotta bots on reddit Ireland stating they are Irish but then use American spellings and American phrases not used here - EG we spell criticise with an S. They also post at times when most of the country will be in bed. \n\nOn their own these signs might not mean it's a bot but if you see several it may well be. Also if it's not a bot then it's likely a troll (paid for or free) and those aren't worth your time either. It's about looking at the source and using some critical thinking.\n\nIt takes like 10 seconds to look and check who you're talking to, and save your time, energy and mental health before responding.\n\nI spend too much of my time pointing out to people that they are trying to argue in good faith with a bot or a troll, that it's not worth it. So save your energy, always lookmto see where the information/comment comes from. 90% it's not worth your time.",

The media have glamorized certain lifestyles, and some individuals have been led to believe that they should have many friends, date frequently in college, or own a big house by their 30s. Fear of missing out (FOMO) and societal expectations about what one should accomplish by a certain age can lead to anxiety and guilt. Additionally, we may not be prepared or ready to undertake certain tasks at that time. Many people who marry young have a higher chance of divorce. Regret is a natural part of life, even for those you perceive to have it all, if you get close to them.\n\nThe truth is that we all have different life experiences, and everyone will miss out on something. It’s more important to focus on your individual goals at a pace that suits you than to rush. You can always revisit things you haven’t experienced before, and sometimes those experiences can be even better. Life becomes easier when you focus on your own individual goals and experiences rather than trying to meet every milestone or invisible expectation. You should accept that you’ll miss out on something and start building your own experiences in the present. Do what fits you personally, and stop trying to copy your peers or beating yourself up for not achieving milestones by a specific age.",

It will be cringy the first couple of times, but it will make you such a better interviewee. \n\nFirst, pay attention to the overuse of filler words like “um”, “you know”, … they can make you sound unprepared. In the middle of an interview, when you face an unexpected or complicated question, it might be better to take a second to gather your thoughts before you start talking.\n\nBe also aware of answers that are too lengthy. It is a sign that you might be repeating yourself or giving too many details. In other words, don’t ramble, be concise and to the point. Long-winded answer put your interviewers to sleep, and you don’t want to lose their attention.\n\nSome interview questions are expected. Therefore, you are also expected to give a thoughtful answer to them. It shows that you took the interview seriously. For example, “Tell me about yourself”, “why are you the best candidate for this position?”, “Do you have any questions for us?”\n\nFinally, have a strong closing statement on why you should be hired. And ask for the job !\n\nKeep practicing and recording yourself until you feel good about your answers. Good luck on the job market !\n\nEdit: I think there might be some confusion based on some initial replies. I am not suggesting that you memorize potential answers, but to keep practicing common questions and record yourself until you are able to answer a typical interview question in a concise, thoughtful and structured way. Once you are able to structure your answers in an effective way, you can apply it to most questions that come your way in a natural manner. Your answers should be concise and structured. \nFor example, for situational questions like “Tell me about a time when…”, it is most effective to use the STAR method.\nS: Explain the Situation\nT: talk about the Task or problem\nA: describe the Actions you took to address the problem\nR: Explain the positive Results you were able to achieve\n\nSource: Experience as a hiring manager.",

      "I disagree personally. The best job interviews for me felt natural and more like a conversation. If you focus too much on optics and trying to have the perfect tone, answer, etc for what you think they will ask, you will be thrown off if what they ask isn’t what you rehearsed.\n\nReally you should be comfortable explaining your skills and experience, and not put so much pressure on yourself. It’s very hard to do at first I totally agree, but the more experience you get, the easier it becomes.\n\nIf you are clearly qualified and have a little awkwardness (but a good attitude and work ethic) and they won’t hire you because you aren’t charismatic enough, then it’s probably not a role or company for you anyways.",
      "Oh man, recording yourself, it's like watching old home videos of yourself on a bad hair day. But seriously, I love this tip—back in the day, I felt like I had a whole alternate persona during interviews. My voice would go all squeaky, and my arms, God, they had a mind of their own. Recording can be a game-changer, though. You get to see all the quirks, and over time, you become so much more confident.\n\nI remember practicing for an interview by recording myself on my laptop, just to see what I looked like when I was trying to sound all professional. It was awkward at first, but watching it really helped me tweak things, like toning down the excessive nodding and chilling out a little instead of sounding like I was on fast-forward. And that STAR method you mentioned? Total lifesaver. It gives you a mini roadmap for those tricky ones and keeps things focused.\n\nAnother thing I found super helpful was throwing in a few real-life anecdotes. Like, I’d think back to a time I genuinely crushed it at work and just weave that magic into my answers, keeping it all relevant, of course. It makes you come across as more relatable and not just like you're reciting from a script.\n\nBut yeah, asking for the job at the end—this tip is gold. At first, I was all like, “Do people actually do that?” But it sticks you in their memory and shows you’re serious. Plus, it sets a nice, confident tone to end on. Anyway, practice is everything, or at least that's what I keep telling myself..."
