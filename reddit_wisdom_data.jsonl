{"title": "LPT: If your teen has recently started driving, teach them how to change the tire safely on the car they will drive the most", "selftext": "I\u2019m an older guy, but I\u2019ve had to change flat tires on a road and even interstate highways at least a dozen times. Young drivers need to know how to find a safe way to pull off the road, plus every aspect of changing the tire.  \n\nFinding the spare, the jack, the wrench, and wheel chocks if you have them. Show them the jack points on the car, because newer cars will be damaged if you put a scissor jack in the wrong place. Loosen the lug nuts or lug bolts a little before jacking up the car. How to free frozen lug nuts. How to get the wheel off if it is stuck on. How to attach the tire, remove the jack, and then snug up the lugs. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to be sexist in any way, but speaking as a parent myself, it is critical than young ladies learn how to do this, and not just young men. Roadside assistance services are not always available, and unfortunately, not everyone who stops to help is an actual Good Samaritan. \n\nA few more general tips, as I have had super bad luck with the sheer volume of flat tires I\u2019ve had to fix. \n\n- Every 2 years or so, loosen the lug nuts/bolts on all tires on all your cars, then re-tighten them. This is for 2 reasons. First, if the wheel has not been removed in a long time, the threads can be either rusted or micro-welded together, making it damn difficult to break the nut/bolt loose. I have had to find a piece of pipe that slipped over the wrench handle, then repeatedly jump on it, to break nuts loose. Second, if you take your car to a mechanic to have the tires rotated or to get new tires - these guys often use power tools to put the nut on, and they over-torque it, making it very hard to break loose with hand tools. \n\n- put a very large rubber mallet or a 3 foot long, cleanly cut 4x4 in your trunk. Most cars that use lug bolts (instead of lug nuts) have a small (3/16-1/4 inch, or 4-6mm) cylindrical projection on the brake rotor, and a matching recess on the back side of the wheel. The reason for this thing is so you can lift up the tire and get it to mate with the brake rotor, then just rotate the wheel until the holes in the wheel line up with the threaded holes in the brake rotor, so you can insert the lug bolts while being able to keep the wheel roughly in place with one hand.  If the wheel has not been removed for years, these two surfaces can seize, so that even after you remove the lug bolts, you still can\u2019t get the wheel off. So essentially, you need to hit the wheel rim with a big \u201cthumper\u201d to break it loose. \n\nHope this lengthy LPT helps keep you and your kids more safe, if they get a flat.", "comments": ["### This post has been marked as safe.

Most of the common suggestions don't work in my case. I can't talk to anyone there as nobody is talkative; many of them don't want to speak at all, regardless of language or experiences or anything. There's often a 3-hour period where not a word of conversation is uttered by anyone on the entire factory floor (including two assembly lines and a testing area). There were only two people who wanted to hold a conversation there, and they both quit two weeks ago.\n\nWe're highly micromanaged and don't get to choose our own break times or spots to sit in, we can't have any food on the factory floor (no snacks) or even refill water/coffee/tea until our breaktimes. We can take bathroom breaks if they're short, but other than that we are not allowed to move from our stations until the end of the night.\n\nWe can't look at our phones during the shift except on breaks, wear headphones or earbuds, or play music through our phone speakers. Bringing a portable radio *might* be possible (I'll ask next week).\n\nThe most I can do is choose whether I stand or sit (although most of the work requires sitting), push my chair from one side of my table to the other, sip water (has to last me 3 hours per refill, so slowly), and go to the bathroom.\n\nTo top it all off, the work comes at an agonizing pace that is too slow to get into a flow and too fast to zone out and take mental breaks. Generally, I'll get something that takes 15 seconds to do every 30 seconds. Also if one of the production lines finishes their daily quota before the day's out, there is an endless supply of \"prepwork\" and other busywork to keep us occupied as the manager does not want anyone to be \"idling\". So even if we finish our work early, there's endless fake work waiting. Last week I spent an hour manually checking parts that I had already confirmed were good before, they just handed me a box of 500 pieces that had already been checked and I checked it again.\n\nI'm seriously at my wit's end here. This job is crushing my soul. I don't even have the energy to apply to anything else on my off days because I'm so burnt out.\n\nThis isn't even mentioning the physical issues; my feet are soaking in their own sweat in my steeltoes which causes a ton of skin issues despite trying to wear moisture-wicking socks, and I don't have enough room to even wiggle my toes which gets oppressive. My shoulders are killing me from repetitive strain, and I have to spend half of both my breaks going to the very back of the building (by the loading docks) where my locker is to get some hand lotion so my skin stops cracking. We have to wear these cheap ESD straps that need to be pulled so tight they dig in and irritate. The air in there is full of dust that makes my nose just that little bit irritated, and because there's irritants used in the production process it's very hard to get the chance to scratch your face or anything.\n\nThe management/supervision is also nasty. Not a big deal, but when there's already so many annoyances going on, it starts to upset me.\n\nAny help? I'm seriously dying out here. I've been here a few weeks already, seen all the good conversationalists quit, but I have nowhere to go back to other than this (coming from a highly abusive home environment in a city where rent is prohibitively high).

{"title": "LPT: It's fledgling season! Here are a few tips in case you come across a baby bird on the ground.", "selftext": "Ecologist here! It's that time of year again when the ground is covered in baby birds, some should be there and some should not. So here are a few tips so you know when to intervene and when to leave them alone.\n\nIf you find a baby bird on the ground the first thing to do is check for injuries. Baby birds can look pretty weak, but if you don't see any blood or obvious damage then it's fine. If it is injured do not try to take it home and nurse it back to health, birds require specific diets and handling and even most of them don't make it when cared for by their parents let alone an unequipped human. Please call a wildlife rehabber.\n\nThe second thing to check for is age:\n\nIf it hasn't opened its eyes yet and is mostly pink and featherless it's a hatchling (0-3 days old). Hatchlings should not be out of the nest. If you see a hatchling and the nest it fell out of you can try to put it back in (that old wive's tale about birds not taking care of chicks touched by humans is false). If you can't see the nest you can make your own out of a small container lined with soft material then attach it to a tree or bush as high as you can. If it looks like the parents are not caring for it after an hour or so call a local wildlife rehabber to come get the hatchling. If the bird is invasive, a starling or house sparrow for example (invasive in the Americas and other parts of the world, they are native to Europe and important parts of ecosystems in their native range), a lot of rehabbers euthenize them.\n\nIf its eyes are open and it's got a few spikey (pin) feathers it's a nestling (3-13 days old) and also not ready to leave the nest. Please adhere to the advice above about hatchlings.\n\nIf its eyes are open and its fully feathered, hopping around, maybe a little fluffy, short tail, its a fledgling (13+ days old). Leave these cuties alone! They are working on flying and probably exhausted and in need of rest before they take off again. Their parents are around, even if you cannot locate them, and are feeding this little guy or gal. No need to call anyone or do anything unless it is injured. If it is in the street and might get hit by a car you can herd them to the side of the road or under a bush. The parents will find it.\n\nI know everyone means well and it's hard to look at a baby bird and not want to do anything. But you only need to worry about the hatchlings and nestlings or an injured fledgling.\n\nQuick Note - Some birds are ground nesters so they will be on the ground no matter what, but the chances of you finding a ground nesting bird is not very high. If you're in the U.S. Killdeer, ovenbirds, bobolinks, swans, ducks, geese, etc. all nest on the ground and their chicks will be there in all their forms. Shorebirds also nest on the ground, so if you're at the beach you'll see plover, sanderlings, and other wading birds. This post is really for folks finding non-ground nesting birds in urban and suburban areas.\n\nIf you have an outdoor cat or dog, please stop trying to change the wild bird behavior. Take your pet, which is an invasive species, into your home until the bird leaves the area. Monitor your dog or cat while outside, keep them in if you can't supervise while chicks are out. It's only a few weeks you have to pay attention.", "comments": ["### This post has been marked as safe.

{"title": "LPT \"Driving\" on virtual calls is a good skill to have to get noticed and become part of higher level meetings in an office job setting.", "selftext": "If you're in an office job, there may be times when there is live collaboration over a zoom/teams call: Talking about changes to a presentation and editing it live, working on a shared document, brainstorming ideas, testing new code. In these settings, being the \"driver\" (the person who shares their screen and often makes edits offered by the other callers) can be a great way to facilitate the meeting in a way that's noticed and sought out by management. Often managers have split attention and little time to work on things directly so being able to help realize their vision live on a call is very valuable. \n\nTo be a good driver you should:\n\n-Be fast. Learn as many shortcuts, hot keys, formulas and \"hacks\" for the relevant softwares that you use. There's a point where if you cannot drive as fast as the meeting moves, the meeting becomes inefficient and it's better to just schedule a follow-up and do the work off the call. This is fine, but the skill is being able to drive fast enough that you can finalize a lot in one meeting with managers who are hard to pin down for working sessions. Even if you're good at PowerPoint, excel, coding, writing, drawing; doing it quickly can be a different skill altogether.\n\n-Prioritize the \"version 1\". When ideas are being thrown around it's better to just create rough versions and leave polish for when you are working on it independently. The most important thing to do on a call, especially with managers, is understand what they're looking for, give them a rough draft, confirm that you understood them, and then come back later with a finished product.\n\n-Learn driving language. \"So we're good with this part as is?\", \"What do we think about this?\", \"What I'm hearing is that you want me to ___, is that right?\", \"I can fix the formatting off the call, but is this basically what we're looking for?\". You want to encourage feedback, but also gently encourage participants to confirm verbally their approval as you go. If they don't like it, get them to say what and why.\n\n-Do as much pre work as you can. If you have multiple versions or a rough outline ready to go ahead of time, editing live becomes easier.\n\n-When no editing or document is involved, good driving can just be taking good notes that you can distribute after a call. Many times I share screen with my notes just so people on the call have something to look at. Managers who spend lots of time in meetings appreciate notes like these and will often clarify their own thoughts more when they see them written out. Emphasize action items if there are any and who is responsible for each one.\n\n-A second screen is important as a driver if there are things you want to do that you don't want to show up on your shared screen. \n\nIf you are a good driver you may find yourself getting invited onto calls with bosses above your direct boss. Boomers especially love having someone just create what they say verbally. It lets them work as fast as they can think which they might not be able to do on their own. You also get to be a part of more of the idea generation process and offer your own insights where appropriate. \n\nA lot of this advice is geared towards project based work, but any job that has collaborative virtual calls can benefit from a skilled driver.\n\nETA: \"Driving\" is what people in my office call being the person to share their screen. Probably goes by other names elsewhere, but when we pass the screen share off some one will usually say something to the effect \"I'll start driving\".\n\nPeople made the excellent point that being the driver can be a slippery slope to getting pigeon holed into admin work or note taking. I'll just say there are different levels of driving in my mind:\n\n1. Taking dictation: You are simply there to type out or draft the ideas of the other call participants. You are not given the opportunity to contribute and therefore your involvement is literally the key strokes on the screen. This is bad, and you don't want to get stuck in this especially if your job description does not specifically call for it. If you fill this role you might want to create a boundary that this is outside your scope of work or it should at least not fall solely on your shoulders.\n\n2. Facilitating: You are interpreting ideas, creating consensus and encouraging feedback from the most important stakeholders. Here you are not only taking in ideas from participants but also offering your own perspective. The keystrokes and drafting are more incidental to taking an active role in the call and this is a synthesis of soft social skills and being proficient in software to create work product live. \n\n3. Leading: This is what a driver further into their career will do. You are the one ideating and distributing action items and defining requirements. Where the driving skillset is still relevant is in soliciting questions, creating mock ups that subordinates can use as starting points to create finished work, and fostering a collaborative environment. You can also model how to drive a collaborative call and maybe foster the skills in others.", "comments": ["### This post has been marked as safe.

doing it quickly can be a different skill altogether. -prioritize the \"version 1\". when ideas are being thrown around it's better to just create rough versions and leave polish for when you are working on it independently. the most important thing to do on a call, especially with managers, is understand what they're looking for, give them a rough draft, confirm that you understood them, and then come back later with a finished product. -learn driving language. \"so we're good with this part as is?\", \"what do we think about this?\", \"what i'm hearing is that you want me to ___, is that right?\", \"i can fix the formatting off the call, but is this basically what we're looking for?\". you want to encourage feedback, but also gently encourage participants to confirm verbally their approval as you go. if they don't like it, get them to say what and why. -do as much pre work as you can. if you have multiple versions or a rough outline ready to go ahead of time, editing live becomes easier. -when no editing or document is involved, good driving can just be taking good notes that you can distribute after a call. many times i share screen with my notes just so people on the call have something to look at. managers who spend lots of time in meetings appreciate notes like these and will often clarify their own thoughts more when they see them written out. emphasize action items if there are any and who is responsible for each one. -a second screen is important as a driver if there are things you want to do that you don't want to show up on your shared screen. if you are a good driver you may find yourself getting invited onto calls with bosses above your direct boss. boomers especially love having someone just create what they say verbally. it lets them work as fast as they can think which they might not be able to do on their own. you also get to be a part of more of the idea generation process and offer your own insights where appropriate. a lot of this advice is geared towards project based work, but any job that has collaborative virtual calls can benefit from a skilled driver. eta: \"driving\" is what people in my office call being the person to share their screen. probably goes by other names elsewhere, but when we pass the screen share off some one will usually say something to the effect \"i'll start driving\". people made the excellent point that being the driver can be a slippery slope to getting pigeon holed into admin work or note taking. i'll just say there are different levels of driving in my mind: 1. taking dictation: you are simply there to type out or draft the ideas of the other call participants. you are not given the opportunity to contribute and therefore your involvement is literally the key strokes on the screen. this is bad, and you don't want to get stuck in this especially if your job description does not specifically call for it. if you fill this role you might want to create a boundary that this is outside your scope of work or it should at least not fall solely on your shoulders. 2. facilitating: you are interpreting ideas, creating consensus and encouraging feedback from the most important stakeholders. here you are not only taking in ideas from participants but also offering your own perspective. the keystrokes and drafting are more incidental to taking an active role in the call and this is a synthesis of soft social skills and being proficient in software to create work product live. 3. leading: this is what a driver further into their career will do. you are the one ideating and distributing action items and defining requirements. where the driving skillset is still relevant is in soliciting questions, creating mock ups that subordinates can use as starting points to create finished work, and fostering a collaborative environment. you can also model how to drive a collaborative call and maybe foster the skills in others. ### this post has been marked as safe. upvoting/downvoting this comment will have no effect. --- hello and welcome to r/lifeprotips! please help us decide if this post is a good fit for the subreddit by upvoting or downvoting this comment. if you think that this is great advice to improve your life, please upvote. if you think this doesn't help you in any way, please downvote. if you don't care, leave it for the others to decide. lol. i read your title and i thought you were advocating for showing that you can drive a car and still be productive to a conference call. show that go get them attitude. early into your career you can\u2019t wait to get invited into the important meetings. mid career you want to run them. late career you simply hope to gtfo of all meetings and people drama as quickly as possible.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1k45b8j/lpt_driving_on_virtual_calls_is_a_good_skill_to/", "score": 5500, "subreddit": "LifeProTips", "created_utc": 1745210581.0}

The media have glamorized certain lifestyles, and some individuals have been led to believe that they should have many friends, date frequently in college, or own a big house by their 30s. Fear of missing out (FOMO) and societal expectations about what one should accomplish by a certain age can lead to anxiety and guilt. Additionally, we may not be prepared or ready to undertake certain tasks at that time. Many people who marry young have a higher chance of divorce. Regret is a natural part of life, even for those you perceive to have it all, if you get close to them.\n\nThe truth is that we all have different life experiences, and everyone will miss out on something. It\u2019s more important to focus on your individual goals at a pace that suits you than to rush. You can always revisit things you haven\u2019t experienced before, and sometimes those experiences can be even better. Life becomes easier when you focus on your own individual goals and experiences rather than trying to meet every milestone or invisible expectation.

total lifesaver. it gives you a mini roadmap for those tricky ones and keeps things focused. another thing i found super helpful was throwing in a few real-life anecdotes. like, i\u2019d think back to a time i genuinely crushed it at work and just weave that magic into my answers, keeping it all relevant, of course. it makes you come across as more relatable and not just like you're reciting from a script. but yeah, asking for the job at the end\u2014this tip is gold. at first, i was all like, \u201cdo people actually do that?\u201d but it sticks you in their memory and shows you\u2019re serious. plus, it sets a nice, confident tone to end on. anyway, practice is everything, or at least that's what i keep telling myself...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1j6jklq/lpt_when_preparing_for_a_job_interview_record/", "score": 250, "subreddit": "LifeProTips", "created_utc": 1741447888.0}
